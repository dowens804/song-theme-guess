Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics.

            "lyrics": "\n\r\nThe old wolf sniffs the summer breeze, and dreams about his youth,\nFor the sight of skirts above the knees turns his hardboiled brain to tears.\nAnd the scent of honey in the tree whets an old sweet tooth.\nThe pretty girls go strolling by, I smile at them, and heave a sigh.\nAnd think of all the things I've missed, and all the pretty girls I've never kissed.\nThey smile from field of daffodils, they wave from high and windy hills,\nIn secret places by the sea, the girls I've never kissed still wait for me.\nAll the girls whose names I can't recall, their faces haunt me still,\nAll the pretty girls I've never kissed and never will.\nThe girls of spring, the girls of fall, the girls of summer most of all,\nIf only time did not exist, if only I could catch that boat I always missed,\nI'd go back and kiss all the pretty girls I've never kissed.\n"

From the ending!\nWonderful!\n\nAnd while we are swinging, to mention a few\nWe'll drop in at Danny's, The Little Club too\nBut wind up at Jilly's, whatever we do\nLife is gonna be we-wow-whee!\n(Wow!)\nFor my shadow and me!\n\nFrank?\nOh, forget it Sam.\n"

I think I'm gonna make it all the way,\nBaby, get out of my way.\n"

            "lyrics": "\n\r\nStars in the sky were dancing\nOne night perfect for romancing\nThe night a sinner kissed an angel\nHe wanted thrills, she wanted love\n\nOh, but his sighs were tender\nAs he begged her to surrender\nThe night a sinner kissed an angel\nAnd she believed that it was love\n\nHow was she to know that every lovely vow\nWas part of the game he was playing\nBut to his surprise he realized\nSomehow he meant every word he was saying\n\nYes, miracles can happen\nI know 'cause I saw one happen\nThat night a sinner kissed an angel\nThat was the night I fell in love\n"

Totally Animal\nAnd the Face Paint brings it forth ha, ha, ha\n"

Cru...\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI'm on a pilgrimage to the rhyme mecca\nBecause I'm Tecca\nAnd this mind left ya\nDown at the bottom because N9ne's betta\nAnd if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness\nThey in a mess bind and yes I sever decay em and define pressure\nI'm a spit it for\nBiggot wars and not a critic whore\nHit ignore\nI got a cynic core\nIn this war your not a

Krizz Kaliko]\nWho are these dudes we never let any of these fools cheat on the rules\nKristopher egotistical narcistic whicha\nIf they say no then we tell 'em to get up n move we makin' some room\nI heard of these guys, murderous when it comes to scripture\nUbiquitous, and Godemis, they Gods to us\nWe Gods to them, so we meet right in the middle\nTo the fat fry it up a little\nWhen it's unfair, we got there hands in the air\nAnd you can't even get a show\nNo one cares that your freestyle so rare\nBut no body care, nobody know\nIt's easy for them physical favors\nWhy ya'll just spend all your paper\nBreezes bend over the table\nTattoos embezzle my label\nDrivin n traffic n rhymes them choppers Africanized\nWe what is happenin to your wife\nWhile your at 9 to 5's\nYou might as well stop

dream\nSince I was runnin around in my umbro\nAnd you heard it direct from my mouth piece\nTech scattered me out and found me\nTurn out we the perfect strangers\nLary appleton and balky\nI was out east\nWhen a text came in, with Tech sayin what is about to be\nBefore you fuck me on the dough, know that everybody around lookin out for me\nNow that we got that in the air\nI can feel the change in the atmosphere\nA crew been livin in limbo\nApprently all this rappin has trapped us here\nAnd after years they hearin we lost inside the dream\nNot necessarily\nI won't let this rap thing bury me\nI'm a let these bat wings carry me\n\n[Backwards:]\nIt's unfair to be\nSuch a mother fuckin rarity\nBeware that we tear many squares\nIf he dares to be a parody of this clarity\n"

If so those words you speak I can't admire\nThe evil's in my past but today the saint is ire\nGet and give a lot of love, guess my 'ologists follows us\nI was thug, taught us, now we caught up in goddish hugs\nEverywhere we go, there he go, went from very low\nTo unnecessary owes when he carries flows over the stereo\nI'm, on my 7 all because of rhyme\nBut because I played the 6 once upon a time\nThe reverend says my worldly ways I need to deaden\nBut I can't tell because this life I'm living feel like heaven\n\n[Bridge 1: Krizz Kaliko]\nIs it heaven, or is my head up in the clouds\nIs there hell for me, because I feel like we made it out\nI put my halo on but then, it done came off again\nYou don't need eyes to see, that this could be our only heaven\n\n[Hook: Nikkiya]\nSo, if you see my feet up off the ground\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\nOh, if you see my halo falling down\nOh, don't you let me tear this heaven down\n\n[Verse 2: Oobergeek]\nIt's funny, and when I think I'm up there...\nThey say I fais le cul to much\nBut they just d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu to much\nCaught up in the antics\nYeah I'm tied to you because I was thinking semantics\nSo is it dependent on what your heaven is?\nOr how big your 6 and 7 is?\nEverything preaches to you, you decipher who the reverend is\nThis verse is speaking to the ones seeking peace in any form\nFar from norm' imaginations, the brain rains when it storms\nYou say names then it forms, manifest things that were foreign\nTo you once upon a time no coincidence is gonna rhyme\nMake sense in a normal line\nOf words you learned them at the time and they remain timeless\nFeeding of the dreams that you promised\nBefore niggas knew you were prominent and dominant\nAnd all those powerful words that back then, to be honest,\nWere just nouns and verbs; the looks on the astonished\nAre normal by now I seen them same faces when I was in Spiderman pajamas\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nHeaven or Hell?\nI never thought that this could be so real\nI never thought that I would ever build\nMy own heaven\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nI remember back in the day I had this song called \"My Own Hell.\"\nIt was depressing.\nBut since then, I've created my own heaven, baby!\nAnd it's beautiful!\n\nIncredibly, no one deaded me, when it was lead at these red Dickies,\nNobody ever headed me, let it be, said I'm breaded, B\nReal light, within darkness I still fight it,\nBut if heaven is love, then this sure in the hell feel like it!\n"

Moved to LA that summer, came back to KC in '98. Started doing music with my childhood homies 57 RDV's. Started doing shows with them in our area like LU Homecoming and venturing out to Top City, then Denver and Dallas. Met Trav in '99, started doing Strange Music in 2000. Released Anghellic that year, and it spread like crazy. We started doing hella shows in our city, and surrounding cities\n"

everywhere I go I try to get to the money\n\n[Rittz:]\nI've been feeling like Pablo in the Wells Fargo\nI ain't here to talk about a car loan\nPockets on my cargo shorts full of money\nAnd a duffel bag stuffed full, hard to keep the zipper on the top closed\nYou can barely pay a car note\nWhy you mad at me because your credit score low\nI done gone broke but I bounced back\nLeaning on the counter while she look at my account\nCan I have a lollipop\nDon't run the game flirtin' with the bank teller\nI can tell she thinking I'm a cocaine dealer\nI got cash 'cause I rap, I don't trap\nI was hurting when I didn't have money, now the paper like a painkiller\nThe internet say I'm worth four mil\nIt used to be a way worse ordeal\nNo more dollar menu orders, eating four course meals\nThought I was a winner look at what the scoreboard said\nForrest Gump with the ends on the cat running\nOn the way to make a milli you can bet on me\nYou sitting still like a crash test dummy\nLike you got a check coming\nTryna flash, you ain't got Tech money\nYou ain't ever live lavish, tryna be Travis\nYou ain't ever built like that\nYou been living in a fantasy knowing that you can't achieve\nI'ma tell you real life fast\nKeep it real like that\nYeah\n\n[Jeff James:]\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy, 'bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy, everywhere I

bit of labor\nWith them brand new hunnids\nDamn you done it\nNot a way somebody can ever ban you from it\nHow can you stomach\nThe poverty I hit the lottery\nSo when you go in the pile can you plummet\nDamn you stuntin'\nOn the land when you expand the grands\nThey gonna stand who run it and the jam you brung it (cha)\nComin' from all the fans the Kansas City man do gun it (cha)\nTake all the paper don't let the paper take ya\nBig money maker you're gonna wait to vapor\nFrom all the haters they wanna waste ya\nLike a trip when they hit a gallon of J\u00c3\u00a4ger\nOff with the money

on the go without a chill\nWe two up, it's too much money to be made\nToo much money for me to ever be a slave\nToo much money for me to not wanna get out of the bed and go get it\nSomebody already gettin' paid\nIt don't matter if you rappin' or thuggin', be stackin' or pluggin'\nIt's either you are slackin' or puppin', I bet that you want it\nThey give in if you huff at the oven\nAnd you rapping a couple of 'em\nMoving two by fours like Jim Duggan, you buggin'\nIf you don't got the lucrative hustle\nLooking for loot producing part of productive 'cause you\nGotta be tough and plus you gotta do what you must do\nThrow it when you win, they will son the rustle\nI see hawks when I see these thots, and I read thoughts\nLet them wonder 'bout the bread\nHe financially flaunts cause he know what she wants\nLet alone fucks I give 'em the photo cred\nEven though I do collect the dough, I haven't changed yet\nNever quit, never sit waiting for a paycheck\nTo the paid jet, then get

This week, they have responded to ZERO emergency calls. Kansas City School Officials are also reporting some dramatic changes since the burgundy skies overtook the city. Student attendance and test scores are BOTH up significantly.\n\nSchool administrators as well as the police chiefs say if this dramatic change is a result of our new burgundy skies, then they certainly hope the burgundy mist will keep spreading for the good of man-kind.\n\nThey say their hope is that this, cold harsh earth, will eventually become a better place for us all to live.\n\nI'm Mark Alford, Goodnight.\n"

Spit it out! Evil in ya mix! Rid it out!\nDon't ever wanna see, what that pit about\nWe just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out\nGet it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix! Rid it out!\nDon't ever wanna see, what that pit about\nWe just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out\n\nI'm fighting for a bright life, but evil wanna consume me\nAnd my soul is the right price\nThat would literally be a fright night\nBut I ain't sellin' my soul to hell\nAngels yellin' propellin' flight heights\nWanna spread those angel wings\nBut they have wicked entangled things\nLike steaming hot tar with the stench of brimstone\nKnee in God's yard\nCan I repent the sin gone?\nDid that done that then the evil comes back\nRunnin' from myself it seems it ain't no runnin' from that\nJust when you wanna start anew\nThey judge you on what you used to be\nThus makin' it harder too but I refuse to lose\nEven if I gotta be banged and bruised\nWhy do we have to battle just to go the bright route\nOh well I'm bout to beat this hell until it's lights out\n\nAlive and I'm well, did I win in hell?\nThe fight just to save my soul\nCause time and time again\nWhen I crawl to the light I land in sin\nNow my sins so far away\nThat darkness will never find me\n\nHideous hideous... grotesque grotesque...\n"

I'm in here doing my job, now I'm in the hotseat because of something them niggas said, you know so it's on accident. So, therefore, if we abort this, all the beats are go away, which we wrote everything around these beats, you know what I'm sizzling? But I had to look at it broad-spectrum.

I, I tuned em out\nToo busy turnin on and droppin out behind my\nMy mommas house, producing clouds\nNever understood my need to get numb me\nWhile I'm bleedin out my eyes, even out my lungs\nTryin to avoid the sun\nCurious at a young age for a taste\nWatchin them numb they face\nTook Caroline found someone for us to bring out on dates\nI call it youthful curiosity\nJump the edge every Saturday\nStrobe lights an low lives the city at night was callin me\nI turned em out.. I, I turned em out\nHad em both kissin on my lips n smoke the spliff to boost the trip\nLift off, I'm gone\nPhone call to my bro lettem know that I'm lost\nAnd I got sand in my shoes from twilight beach M\u00c3\u00a9nage \u00c3\u00a0 trois\nHeavy sedated eyes, grew up with jaded eyes\nSee she's been friends of mine since 99\nBut now we don't see eye to eye\nI cant retrogress, unless life gets to heavy for my chest\nThen I'll be tuning out again and droppin out before they win.\n"

Now the impact can be felt as far away as downtown Kansas City with tremors felt in high rise office buildings.\n\nThe eyewitness reports are just now coming into the news room. NOAA, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, does have an office there in Pleasant Hill. Residents of Pleasant Hill definitely heard and felt the strike and now they wanna know: how could this happen?\n\nOn what would normally be a bright and sunny day here in Kansas City, a fog of some sort is now starting to roll north from pleasant hill through Lee Summit, and now approaching the downtown loop. We're getting a good view of it now from our tower cam if you can check it out. In fact, I've never seen anything like this before, it's eerie. Something- something like you'd see in the dust bowl days. Except, it's not dust, it's a mist of some kind. The skies have turned burgundy.\n"

I recorded my first song called \"The Newbury\" there that reached Frozen Image Productions in '91. That's the year that Sol\u00c3\u00a9 took me on my first plane ride to the BRE Convention in New Orleans. And when I returned to KC I started recording hella with Frozen Image. Which lead to me doing Black Expo shows in our city, like where pretty much the first Technicians were born, consisting of gangstas and college kids first. Those shows helped me get other shows in my town, like at Grand Emporium and Party House and eventually winning a rap contest to open up for E.P.M.D. at the Camp Arena\n"

'Cause I sink deep while they stirring tea\nSubterranean alien, stunned and gunning over greedy beats\nFake bulletins, they full of shit, plumed and running under city streets\nNothing worse than a pipe dream, want smoke? Better know that my team-\nWith the hijinx that determ' why eyes pink bruh\nYou don't wanna know what I think\n\n[Godemis:]\nWhy do they wanna be all on me like I was catering, told 'em I play to win\nHaters who waited on me to be caving in gotta come up with a whole 'nother way to win\nDumping that paddle on top of the paint again, breaking the chain to get over the gate again\nFeeling so livid the minute I made it in, head over heels when they come in to hate on it\nBut it never matted like the weather pattern\nSo every father-fucking head I'm gathering is stones to wrap around the wrings of Saturn\nAnd I'm more than happy that I had to pack 'em in\nGet a dick full for fucking with the Devil\nI'm a curse of the worst version of he who can eat people\n"

seeing Tecca the N9ne go\n\nThey said I'm evil\nThey said I'm totally demon in my cerebral\nThey callin' me criminal, comin' to curse a cathedral\nTo punish the positive, opposin' the peace of the people\nThey said I'm a dreamer, and not a good singer\nThat'll never get bread and no kind of Heaven'll bring ya\nWhen I lessen the N9na\nOppressin' the Tech and left in the wringer\n'Cause I am the effin' best with the lingua\nCalling me failure when you know Tech is a choppin' impaler\nIt's funny when you rolling, they come and try to derail ya\nThe tale fell to hell bruh\nNothing you tell her is stopping me when I nail her\nShe loving the delta\nThe hate gon' show but the faith gon' grow\n'Cause I am a winner and gonna make strong dough\nWhen I take on flow, when the pace don't slow\nIt's comedy saying that Aaron Yates won't blow\n(Yates won't blow, Yates won't blow\nYates won't blow, Yates won't blow)\nYou did this, how you live with the stupidness\nKnowing when I get loose, it get lucrative\nWho can sit through this and boo 'cause it blew to bits\nDoofus is not a muse, it's a duplicate\nRiddle me, riddle me, yo why does a little league\nIn second fiddle belittle me when it'll be literally\nKilla B's on the milla spree to drill 'em and filler flee\nAin't no illa G, reala B, the skill is agility\n\nWhen they be itching to down ya\nThrowing the hate all around ya\nTo all the people that clown ya\nBut not a sound when they come encounter\nA real one, they don't feel none\nSwear you're sitting on just little crumbs\nWhen you really making multi-millions\nWhen they say you lost it, but the deal's done\n\n[Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko:]\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now

angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\n\n[King Iso:]\nIt's crazy what haters say when creating a narrative\nI will flatten 'em all like the apron, no air in it\nMedia maybe is airing it and made a few errors\nIt doesn't matter, money's made and many takin' their share in it\nNobody's thinking about the way that they carry us, staying precarious\nFallin' like the angel that flirted when hated comparison\nWhen I think of our native Americans being named by some terrorists\nI ain't sayin' they're Arabic homie\nI figured I could make it apparent like babies in carriages, but this ain't related to marriages\nWhen I say I'm separated from a lady that married to liberty later that buried it and made me a heretic\nTake a TEC and then carry this to the grave\nInnocent but say we're nefarious, now we hang\nBut them people are fakers and Fairey is on the gang\nPut a target on the face then I count 'em like it's a bang (ugh)\nThey're prepared for this, I made it so there it is\nSo they throw the shade in areas grayer than Maridive\nTuck a.50 for the shade like Anastasia I'm airing it\nAwkward living nowadays man I be stranger than Aaron is\nThey paint you in a slide and try to make you a derelict\nGrammys ain't giving any love to Strange and I'm very sick\n'Cause N9na's on the throne but they say I'm heir to it\nFake ish won't fly like a cape with a tear in it\nDemons swinging low not at your face, call them sweet chariots\nYou know how many people that grow up and don't say what their parents did\nCould've- could've been that, but it could've been bad\nSo doper lives be careful with\nI'm sitting in the nuthouse looking at my freaking therapist like\n\n[Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko:]\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called
